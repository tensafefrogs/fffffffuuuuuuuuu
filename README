A quick and dirty fun project to see what the most common combination of "ffffffuuuuuu" is on the internet.

The python script uses the Google json search API (note that the result counts it returns are a bit different from the web UI), then use the html page to display the data.

I'm still working on making it look a little better.

Inspired much by xkcd: http://xkcd.com/467/
